# DAV (Design artifacts + video)
## Tentative procedure for completion (F 11/15 - F 11/29)
- [ ] Compilation phase (F 11/15 - M 11/18)
  - [ ] Gather all of the core information
  - [ ] Describe all of the core information in plain English
  - [ ] Solidify how many of each diagram we would need

- [ ] Development phase (T 11/19 - F 11/22) (focus more on accuracy and less on aesthetics or fine-grained details)
  - [ ] Create "alpha" versions of the structural diagrams
  - [ ] Create "alpha" versions of the behavioral diagarams

- [ ] Refinement phase (S 11/23 - F 11/29) (maximize RVF after various cycles of feedback and refinement - readability, validity, and fluidity)
  - [ ] Create "beta" versions of the structural diagrams
  - [ ] Create "beta" versions of the behavioral diagrams

## Important points about the design artifacts
- Clearly designate which version of UML is being (>v2.0 is recommended)
- Make sure there is no discrepancy between design and implementation
- Rubric:
  - 16 points for structural diagrams
  - 16 points for behavioral diagrams
  - 8 points for overall quality and presentation + addition of various diagrams that add significant value for clients in understanding and maintaining the system into the future

## Video (R 11/28 - Sun 12/1)
- Minimum total viewing time is 15 minutes -> maybe split into 3-4 smaller videos
- "Your video should be organized to give a clear demonstration of your system in action, including a well-considered test case/scenario that allows you to show how your interface and supporting components operate; and, how your overall system meets the client’s requirements. And your video should highlight your design modifications. There’s no need to spend significant amounts of time demonstrating the capabilities that already existed in the system – focus on the aspects of your system that have been changed, upgraded, etc."
