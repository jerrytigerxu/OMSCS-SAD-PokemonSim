# DAV (Design artifacts + video)
## List of design artifacts
- Class diagram
- [Deployment diagram](https://github.gatech.edu/umilojkovic3/PokemonA3/tree/main/DAV/structuralDiagrams/deployment)
- [Component diagram](https://github.gatech.edu/umilojkovic3/PokemonA3/tree/main/DAV/structuralDiagrams/component)
- [Sequence diagrams](https://github.gatech.edu/umilojkovic3/PokemonA3/tree/main/DAV/behavioralDiagrams/sequence)
- [Use case diagrams](https://github.gatech.edu/umilojkovic3/PokemonA3/tree/main/DAV/behavioralDiagrams/useCase)
- [Activity diagrams](https://github.gatech.edu/umilojkovic3/PokemonA3/tree/main/DAV/behavioralDiagrams/activity)




## Tentative procedure for completion (F 11/15 - F 11/29)
- [x] Compilation phase (F 11/15 - T 11/19)
  - [x] Solidify which diagrams we'll make and how many of each diagram we would need
  - [x] Gather all of the core information for each diagram
  - [x] Describe all of the core information for each diagram in plain English

- [ ] Development phase (W 11/20 - S 11/23) (focus more on accuracy and less on aesthetics or fine-grained details)
  - [ ] Create "alpha" versions of the structural diagrams (deployment, component)
  - [ ] Create "alpha" versions of the behavioral diagrams (sequence, use case, activity)

- [ ] Refinement phase (M 11/25 - F 11/29) (maximize RVF after various cycles of feedback and refinement - readability, validity, and fluidity)
  - [ ] Create "beta" versions of the structural diagrams (deployment, component)
  - [ ] Create "beta" versions of the behavioral diagrams (sequence, use case, activity)

## Important points about the design artifacts
- Clearly designate which version of UML is being (>v2.0 is recommended)
- Make sure there is no discrepancy between design and implementation
- Rubric:
  - 16 points for structural diagrams
  - 16 points for behavioral diagrams
  - 8 points for overall quality and presentation + addition of various diagrams that add significant value for clients in understanding and maintaining the system into the future

## Video (R 11/28 - Sun 12/1)
- Minimum total viewing time is 15 minutes -> maybe split into 3-4 smaller videos
- "Your video should be organized to give a clear demonstration of your system in action, including a well-considered test case/scenario that allows you to show how your interface and supporting components operate; and, how your overall system meets the client’s requirements. And your video should highlight your design modifications. There’s no need to spend significant amounts of time demonstrating the capabilities that already existed in the system – focus on the aspects of your system that have been changed, upgraded, etc."
