# PokemonA3
Assignment 3 repository for Group 55 OMSCS Fall 2024

## Project Components
- The application itself (refer to [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/jbrV8nJR/omscs-6310-sad-group-project) for more detailed instructions)
- DAV (design artifacts + video)
  - We'll have a temporary directory in this repository dedicated to DAV in order to keep everything related to A3 in the same place (when we're ready for deployment, we can consider how to handle the DAV directory)
